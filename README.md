# MatchResultPredictor

## Introduction
The Project is mainly about predicting the results of ipl matches, using the old ipl match histroy. Here we are analysing the old match results, based on that we are judging the outcome of randomly chosen match  and varifying the accuracy of prediction with actual result.
Approach:
1)Normal approach using clustering 
   Here we are creating batsman and bowler clusters using K means algorithm.
2)Decision Tree approach 
		   Here we are Converting the data into decision tree model and using this we are predicting the result
